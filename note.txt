<!-- //With graphql-http, you can 
//just send an HTTP POST request 
//to the endpoint you mounted 
//your GraphQL server on, passing 
//the GraphQL query as the query 
//field in a JSON payload. -->

<!-- do this from the command line with curl 
1) run the server in one terminal.
2) open a second terminal and run the curl code below:
-->
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "{ hello }"}' \
http://localhost:4000/graphql


Also possible to send GraphQL from 
the browser (although the browser 
for me at http://localhost:4000/graphql 
says {"errors":[{"message":"Missing query"}]}
I'm able to open the dev console and) run this:

fetch("/graphql", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Accept: "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: "{ hello }" }),
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log("data returned:", data))
